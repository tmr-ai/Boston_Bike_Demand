# boston_bike_demand
The Boston Bike Demand project was conducted as part of the "Analytics and Application" course at the University of Cologne. The aim of this project was to analyze the Boston bike sharing data from 2016 and develop a predictive model to estimate the number of bikes at specific locations, enabling better management of bike utilization.

# Code
The project code is organized into the following sections:

1. Data Collection and Preparation: This section focuses on gathering and cleaning the necessary data for analysis.
2. Descriptive Analytics: In this section, descriptive statistics and visualizations are utilized to gain insights into the bike sharing data, such as patterns, trends, and distributions.
3. Cluster Analysis: Here, cluster analysis techniques are employed to identify groups or clusters of bike sharing locations based on their characteristics.
4. Predictive Analytics: The main focus of this section is to develop predictive models using time series algorithms to forecast the number of bikes at specific locations. These models can aid in resource allocation and demand planning.

# Data
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the official Boston bike sharing system website: https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data.

The dataset provides valuable information about bike usage, including variables such as date, time, location, and the number of bikes available. This data serves as the foundation for the analysis and prediction tasks.
